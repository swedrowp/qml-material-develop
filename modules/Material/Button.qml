   \brief A push button with a text label.

   A button clearly communicates what action will occur when the user touches it. 
   It consists of text, an image, or both, designed in accordance with your appâ€™s color theme.

   There are three standard types of buttons:

   \list
   \li Floating action button: A circular material button that lifts and displays 
       an ink reaction on press.
   \li Raised button: A typically rectangular material button that lifts and 
       displays ink reactions on press.
   \li Flat button: A button made of ink that displays ink reactions on press but
       does not lift.
   \endlist

   This componenent provides raised and flat buttons. For floating action buttons,
   see \l ActionButton.

   Here are some example buttons:
